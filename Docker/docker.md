## Basics

### Intro

You should have a `Dockerfile` file (the actual file name) in your project. It stores a set of commands.

Example of `Dockerfile`:

```dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .

RUN npm i

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["node", "app.mjs"]
```

1. **Build the Image**

```bash
# `-t` is tag
docker build . -t test
```

2. **Create and start a new Container** over the specified Image **in the attached mode** by default (meaning we're listening to the output of that container). Copy the generated `id` at the bottom of the output (e.g. `a76adbaedb79`) and type

```bash
docker run -it --init -p 5000:5000 40ed76e52694

# `-it`: interactive
# `-p`: local port (in the browser):exposed port (in the app)
```

Your server should be running.

**NB**: Type `Ctrl + q` to exit the input mode if you need.

---

To **apply your changes in the code**, restarting a Container is not enough. Remember that your code is **getting copied** into the Image. So it's basically a **snapshot**.

We need to **rebuild** our code into a new Image. So steps `1.` and `2.` over again.

---

### Utility commands

Show processes

```bash
docker ps
docker ps -a
```

Show images

```bash
docker images
```

Delete unused images. Also can read [this](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-remove-docker-images-containers-and-volumes-ru)

```bash
docker image prune

# Alternatively, something like 
# docker rmi $(docker images -a -q)
```

Stop/restart the **Container** (take the name in the end from `docker ps`)

```bash
docker stop relaxed_poitras

# Starts in the detached mode by default
docker start
```

Kill the Container (take the id from `docker ps`)

```bash
docker kill bbf462dce545
```

See logs

```bash
docker logs amazing_chaplygin

# Start a previously stopped Container && see the logs
docker start amazing_chaplygin && docker logs amazing_chaplygin -f
```

### Images and Containers

A **single Image** usually contains **multiple Containers**.

Image is a **template** that contains the code / tools / runtimes.

Container runs and execudes the code.

---

### `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
# Provide a template for your Image
# The name should be either installed locally under that name or to exist on `hub.docker`

# Path to the working directory in the Container where all the commands (e.g. COPY) will be executed

WORKDIR /app

FROM node:14

# Tells Docker what files and folders to copy to the Image
# arg1: copy from the current local folder
# arg2: copy to the selected Image folder; `./` and `/app` will be the same in this context

COPY . /app

# Runs some commands when the Image is created

RUN npm i

# Runs some commands when a Container is created

CMD ["node", "app.mjs"]

# Exposes a certain port from a Container to our local machine
```

Each command is a **layer** and is getting executed from top to bottom. They are also getting **cached** - you can see that by running `docker build .` multiple times - the subsequent ones run much faster.

The last layer is getting added once your `CMD` command runs. This step is done by Container.

We can upgrade the `Dockerfile` above. Now it runs `npm i` every time when we re-build our Image. This is excessive.

```dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /home/node/backend

COPY package.json /app

RUN npm i

COPY . /app

EXPOSE 80

CMD ["node", "app.mjs"]
```

Now we copy our code to the Image **after** all the dependencies are set, so the layers above **don'e re-run**.

---

### Attached and detached mode

Attached mode translates the Container output to the console automatically.

- `docker run` is using the **attached** (`-a` key) mode by default
- `docker start` is using the **detached** (`-d` key) mode by default

Use `docker attach dreamy_hugle` to attach to the running Container.

The other way to access this data is to inspect `docker logs`.

## Connect Node+TS to Docker

1. Add `"build": "tsc -w &"` to `scripts` in `package.json`
2. Expose `9229` port (the debugging port)
3. Run this script in `Dockerfile`

```dockerfile
FROM node:14

WORKDIR /app

COPY package.json .

RUN npm i

COPY . .

# Run our command from `scripts` in `package.json`
RUN npm run build

EXPOSE 5000
EXPOSE 9229

CMD ["node", "lib/server"]
```

---

### Compose

Replaces multiple `docker build` and `docker run` commands with a **config file** to start all that services.

Use the `docker.compose.yml` (`yaml`) file to configure your applicationâ€™s services. 

Then, with a single command, you create and start all the services from your configuration.

```bash
docker-compose up
docker-compose stop
docker-compose restart
docker-compose down

# Rebuild the container
docker-compose up --build -V 

# Rebuild an `api` service
docker-compose up --build -V api

# Without logs
docker-compose up --build -d -V api

# Also with container names / id
```

My commands:

```bash
# 1. Build `mongo` and `mongo-express` containers
docker-compose up -d mongo mongo-express

# 2. Rebuild and start `api` service (and other services if you have any)
docker-compose up --build -V api
```

## Development vs Production

We create 2 files:

- `docker-compose.yml` - 
- `docker-compose.override.yml` -
